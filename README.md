**About the Project**

I developed this project to improve my Python programming skills and make progress in learning this language. I completed it based on the content of the online course I followed on Udemy. Although it was not a very large project in terms of architecture or scope, it helped me improve my use of new technologies and syntax.

**Technologies Used**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Web Framework:** Flask Framework
* **Database:** MySQL (with Xampp)
* **Screen Design:** HTML
* **Forms:** WTForms
